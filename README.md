# Active Directory Project

## Objective
Setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. Explore how a domain envirnment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM, and generate telemetry related to attack seen in the wild to help understand how to detect them in the future.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis. (Splunk)
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios. (Sysmon)
